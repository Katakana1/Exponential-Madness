# Exponential Madness
An incremental game, which may have the largest numbers of any incremental game. The instructions are here:
# Introduction
First off, you see some multipliers on the screen. There are six of them. You can buy the first one immediately to start the generation of points. You'll see that they are, in fact, growing exponentially.
# Mults 1-5
Once you get back to ten points, you can get another multiplier upgrade for multiplier 1. Then, you can wait to e10 to unlock the second multiplier. You can wait to get each of the mults up to the fifth mult.
# Mult 6
This one is special. It generates mult 5's with a SUPEREXPONENTIAL formula. This speeds the game up massively, and also makes it have some of the largest numbers of any incremental game.
